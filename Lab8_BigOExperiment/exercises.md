# Exercise 1

1. Record here how long it took you to run bubblesort and csort (Note: If you want to run several trials, say '10' and take an average that is an even better result!).

1. bubblesort 10 trial time avg is 348.4 and for csort 10 trial avg is 7.8

# Exercise 2

What is the Big-O complexity of bubblesort?

1. Big-O complexity of bubblesort is O(n^2), where n is the number of items being sorted. 

# Exercise 3

Do a little research and discover what algorithm qsort is in the C standard library. What is the algorithm? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qsort

1. qsort is a polymorphic sorting algorithm for arrays of arbitrary objects. Its considered the 
   'quicker sort' algorithm. 

# Exercise 4

What is the Big-O complexity of 'qsort' that we use in the csort program?

1. Big-O complexity of 'qsort' is O(n^2). 

# Exercise 5

Is qsort's Big-O complexity better or worse than bubblesort? (Anser: Yes it is better/ No it is worse/ It is equal)

5. It is equal! Both equally horrible. 

# Exercise 6

List the following functions in terms of their Big-O complexity from **smallest** to **largest**.

6. LogN; N; N^2; N^3; N!; 2^N

# Exercise 7

- Given: f(n) = 3n^3 + n^2 + 27
- What is the O(n) of f(n)?

7. f(n) is of O(n^2).

# Exercise 8

- Given: f(n) = 3n^3 + n^2 + 27
- What are two constants c and k that prove your answer in exercise 7.

 c = -27; n=1;
